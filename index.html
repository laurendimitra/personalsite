                <p>Lauren is working to become a full-stack developer and has been a junior front-end developer/content manager
                    for two years. While Lauren feels strongly and passionately for digital engineering and development,
                    this was not always the case. Her first love was International Diplomacy and followed closely by Investigatory
                    Journalism. After a few internships in college she quickly realized she more in love with the idea of
                    these careers than the actuality of bureaucracy and monopoly owned bias.</p>
                <p>She first discovered the world of web-design during her departmental honors project in Communications, where
                    Lauren ambitiously decided to build a website and social media platform to raise awareness of human trafficking
                    in America. While she knew nothing of web-design or development, WordPress became her best friend. Post-graduation
                    she took an offer with AmeriCorps at a crisis center for victims of Domestic and Sexual Violence, where
                    she worked again with Wordpress on developing the center’s website.</p>

                <p>Post-service she knew she needed to be in the world of digital marketing and thus applied for a management
                    position she was severely under qualified for. That gutsiness as well as her proven track record of learning
                    quickly and tenaciously, landed her a position as a junior web developer and content manager. After almost
                    two years of working in that position, as well as moonlighting on numerous sites, she feels that she
                    has reached the limit of enjoyment gained from managing the content on sites and is eager to learn more
                    and dive deeper in the stack! Her ideal outcome would be to find a career that helps her balance her
                    thirst for knowledge and love of troubleshooting with an impactful organization that shares her desire
                    to leave the world better than she found it.</p>

                <p>Described by her friends and colleagues as a hard worker, a bit of a weirdo, and a high-functioning punk/hippy
                    hybrid, Lauren is an avid coffee drinker and wine enthusiast. In her spare time Lauren likes to play
                    sports, pick things up and put them down at the gym, and do fun things outside. She is also very into
                    painting, singing, and spending time with her friends. Though, she doesn’t have a ton of free time, because
                    she’s working hard to provide a better life for her cat Tiger Lilly.</p>
